# AI BEHAVIOR RULES

1. **NO TRUNCATION:** When asked to modify, fix, or generate a file, you MUST provide the **FULL** content of the file from start to finish.
2. **NO PLACEHOLDERS:** Do not use comments like `# ... existing code ...`, `# ... rest of file ...`, or `// ... unchanged code`.
3. **COPY-PASTE READY:** The output must be a single, complete code block that can be copied and pasted directly into the file to overwrite it entirely.
4. **STRICT ENFORCEMENT:** Even if the file is long, output the whole thing. If the response limit is reached, stop explicitly and ask to continue.
