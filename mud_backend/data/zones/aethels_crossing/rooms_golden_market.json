Merchants of every race shout their wares, their stalls crammed together under faded, salt-stained awnings. The murmur of a hundred conversations, haggling, and hushed, dangerous-sounding deals, is constant. In the center, a verdigris-stained bronze statue of a forgotten merchant-prince serves as a perch for gulls and a common meeting spot. Paths, slick with grime and commerce, branch out in all directions."
